    <h2>About This Gallery</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my personal collection of anime screenshots!</p>
    <p>This website was created as a passion project to showcase some of the most visually stunning and emotionally impactful moments in anime. Each screenshot is carefully selected to represent the unique art style and atmosphere of the series it comes from.</p>
    <p>The gallery is built as a single-page application, which means you can navigate between pages smoothly without waiting for a full page refresh. The technology stack is pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating a lightweight approach to modern web design.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy browsing the collection as much as I enjoyed putting it together!</p>
